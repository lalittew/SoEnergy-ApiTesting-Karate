Project Overview: This project is created for testing the given Api, using Karate framework
I have used Intellij as IDE and Mac operating system to write the framework
I have already given a run once and test report can be found in path: /Karate-So-Energy/target/karate-reports/karate-summary.html
Please drag and drop this karate-summary.html file in browser to view report
This project includes the setup for running the performance test


Important points including Build and Run this project:
1) All the dependencies are defined in POM.xml file

Run the feature files:
2) Their are two ways to run the feature files
    a) Running individually: This can be done by doing right click on respective feature file and choosing option "Run Feature:GetTesting"
    b) Using FeatureRunner file: This can be done either by right click on 'FeatureRunner' file and choosing option "Run FeatureRunner" or opening
    the file and click small run button next to 'public class FeatureRunner' function

Note: 1) If you want to run just one file via FeatureRunner file then just mention only one file under features option
      2) Also you can run only specific test in all file by defining tags in runner file
      If you want to do that then your runner file should be like
      @RunWith(Karate.class)
      @KarateOptions(features =  {"classpath:feature/GetTesting.feature",
                                  "classpath:feature/PostTesting.feature",
                                  "classpath:feature/PutTesting.feature"},
                      tags = @test)
      public class FeatureRunner {

      }

      3) You can chose the tag name of your choice, but we need to mention same tags(example:@test) before the each scenario in all file

Reports:
3) When you run the tests the report will be generated and will be found in path
    /Karate-So-Energy/target/karate-reports/karate-summary.html

4) To view the report you can either simply open by double click or to view even better just drag and drop in browser

Feature file location:
5) Feature files can be found under path : /Karate-So-Energy/src/test/java/feature

Runner file location:
6) Runner file can be found under path: /Karate-So-Energy/src/test/java/feature/FeatureRunner

7) You can also create a configuration to run Runner file, by creating JUnit runner using edit configuration

CICD file:
8) There is .cirlceci folder which contains config.yaml file with all the steps which helps to integrate with CICD feature of this framework


Performance test:
9) Feature file and simulation file for performance test can be found at path: Karate-So-Energy/src/test/java/PerformanceTest
10) To run the performance test type the below command in terminal
mvn clean test-compile gatling:test

Note: Currently facing some error in running the performance test, as I have not enough time to fix it, I am unable to generate the report
But I am able to implement the framework
